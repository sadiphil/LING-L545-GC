I do not see any issues with this tree. What is not noted on the tree, but is in the file is that -nya on timnya is a 3rd person possessive marker. It also is quite accurate in marking 'pemain' as 'penmain', which is the UR. In Indonesian, a noun can be formed by adding peN- to the beginning of a verb. Here, peN is added to the verb 'main'. In this case, the nasal 'N' assimilates to the 'm' causing the surface form 'pemain'.
