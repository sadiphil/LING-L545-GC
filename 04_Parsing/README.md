I do not see any issues with this tree. What is not noted on the tree, but is in the file is that -nya on timnya is a 3rd person possessive marker. It also is quite accurate in marking 'pemain' as 'penmain', which is the UR. In Indonesian, a noun can be formed by adding peN- to the beginning of a verb. Here, peN is added to the verb 'main'. In this case, the nasal 'N' assimilates to the 'm' causing the surface form 'pemain'.
  
  ## Tree 2

  Usually 'to be' is not the root of a sentence. In this case, it would move to the first noun, but in this case, 'ada' is correctly labeled as the root. In this case 'apakah' is translated as "is there" or "does there" and 'ada' is the main verb being translated as 'to exist'. Direclty translated, the whole sentence is "Does there exist development improvement?". I agree that the compound word perkembangan perbaikan should have the first word governing the second. This is because the word order for compound words is opposite of that in English. So, really its best translation to English would be "Is there any improvement progress?. 
  ## Tree 3

  This sentence has an issue that is also in the test file. That is, in the test file, the word 'selanjutnya' which means 'then, afterwards, hereinafter" is an adverb not an adjective. ALthough, it would still be governed by the root 'kisah'. Usually, within the file, complex words are broken down into their morphemes, but in this case, 'selanhutnya' is not. It should have been broke down into se + lanjut +nya for one + continue + possessive pronoun 3rd person.
  ## Tree 4

  This tree has correctly identified the root verb and in the dictionary file breaks it down into its correct parts of MeN + serang. Amir and Husein are labeled as flat correctly because they are the first and last name of the same person. So, both are proper nouns that do not govern or depend on the other. The phrase 'yang menjadi sekutunya' is marked correctly as the verb 'menjadi' is governing 'yang' (who), as well as 'sekutunya' the object of 'menjadi'. 'Sekutunya' is also broken down into its morphemes in the file as sekut + nya.

 ## Tree 6

 This sentence is labeled correctly. Yakub is a name and is labeled right as a proper noun that depends on the verb 'menyetujuinya'. 'Menyetuhuinya' is labeled correctly as a verb and is broken down into its correct parts in the dictionary file as meN + setuju + i + nya. Although it does label the sentence as 'active', which is correct, it is missing the label 'intransitive' for MeN.
