  ## Tree 1

I do not see any issues with this tree. What is not noted on the tree, but is in the file is that -nya on timnya is a 3rd person possessive marker. It also is quite accurate in marking 'pemain' as 'penmain', which is the UR. In Indonesian, a noun can be formed by adding peN- to the beginning of a verb. Here, peN is added to the verb 'main'. In this case, the nasal 'N' assimilates to the 'm' causing the surface form 'pemain'.
  
  ## Tree 2

  Usually 'to be' is not the root of a sentence. In this case, it would move to the first noun, but in this case, 'ada' is correctly labeled as the root. In this case 'apakah' is translated as "is there" or "does there" and 'ada' is the main verb being translated as 'to exist'. Direclty translated, the whole sentence is "Does there exist development improvement?". I agree that the compound word perkembangan perbaikan should have the first word governing the second. This is because the word order for compound words is opposite of that in English. So, really its best translation to English would be "Is there any improvement progress?. 
  ## Tree 3

  This sentence has an issue that is also in the test file. That is, in the test file, the word 'selanjutnya' which means 'then, afterwards, hereinafter" is an adverb not an adjective. ALthough, it would still be governed by the root 'kisah'. Usually, within the file, complex words are broken down into their morphemes, but in this case, 'selanhutnya' is not. It should have been broke down into se + lanjut +nya for one + continue + possessive pronoun 3rd person.
  ## Tree 4

  This tree has correctly identified the root verb and in the dictionary file breaks it down into its correct parts of MeN + serang. Amir and Husein are labeled as flat correctly because they are the first and last name of the same person. So, both are proper nouns that do not govern or depend on the other. The phrase 'yang menjadi sekutunya' is marked correctly as the verb 'menjadi' is governing 'yang' (who), as well as 'sekutunya' the object of 'menjadi'. 'Sekutunya' is also broken down into its morphemes in the file as sekut + nya.
  ## Tree 5
  ![Image of Sentence 5](https://github.com/sadiphil/Pictures/blob/main/Sentence5.JPG)
  This sentence has the root pushed back further because it starts with a prepositional phrase. It starts with the adposition 'pada' meaning 'according to', which is governed by the noun 'sensus'. Then we have the word 'sensus' that is also governing '1999'. The noun in this prepositionsal phrase is governed by the root 'berjumlah'to total or add up to. Again it is correctly noted in the conllu file that berjumlah has two parts ber + jumlah, but it doesn't have 'ber' marked as transitive. It does have it marked as active though. It does, however, fail to break 'penduduknya' into its correct parts. It correctly identifies -nya as a 3rd person marking, but it fails to identify 'pen-' as the prefix to the verb 'duduk'. However, this improper tagging of the individual morphemes does not affect the tree strucutre as it still labels the final word form correctly as a noun. 
 ## Tree 6

 This sentence is labeled correctly. Yakub is a name and is labeled right as a proper noun that depends on the verb 'menyetujuinya'. 'Menyetuhuinya' is labeled correctly as a verb and is broken down into its correct parts in the dictionary file as meN + setuju + i + nya. Although it does label the sentence as 'active', which is correct, it is missing the label 'intransitive' for MeN.  
 ## Tree 7
  ![Image of Sentence 7](https://github.com/sadiphil/Pictures/blob/main/Sentence7.JPG)
  I don't have any issues with this sentence. It does not, however, include the root in the file for the verb. The root word is 'muara' meaning estuary, and with the prefix 'ber' for transitive verbs, it becomes 'bermuara' which means to empty into an estuary. I agree with 'sisi utara' being a compound noun meaning 'west side' and having a flat righ arc to 'Baigura'. Altogether creating the phrase 'west side of Baigura'. All proper nouns are correctly labeled as proper nouns, which can be a problem for Indonesian because people can often receive a name of an object. When it comes as the first word of a sentence, it could be ambigious whether it is capitalized because of position or because it is a proper noun.
 ## Tree 8
  ![Image of Sentence 8](https://github.com/sadiphil/Pictures/blob/main/Sentence8.JPG)
  There is an issue with this tree that is in the test file as well. The issue is the POS tag on the word 'sebagian'. First, they have 'sebagian' listed as a lemma, but the lemma is 'bagi' with the prefix 'se' meaing 'one' or 'as' and the suffix 'an' which is usually indicative used when deriving a noun from another word class. In some dictionaries, it is labelled as a noun, and in others it is labeled as an adjective, but none label it as a determiner. Both instances would be translated as 'one part' but might be changed for a more comparable translation to 'One part' and 'a part' respectively. According to several dictionaries, 'lagi' should also be labelled as a preposition in this case. Although these parts of speech ar labeled incorrectly, I do still agree with the way the tree is written for the first 'sebagian', but I don't agree with the second one. 'lagi' should be marked as a preposition which is governed by 'Tanara'as here it means 'another' and is the start of the prepositional phrase 'another part in Tanara'.
  ## Tree 9
  ![Image of Sentence 11](https://github.com/sadiphil/Pictures/blob/main/Sentence11.JPG)
This is one of the only sentences that is in the passive. While the passive isn't marked in the tree, it is correctly marked in the conllu file, seperating the verb into its two parts di (passive marker) and dominasi (noun). The compounsd are marked correctly with none marked as 'flat' arcs. They also have 'oleh' marked correctly as an adposition, which is common for passive sentences but not required. It also correctly has the coordinating conjunction 'beserta' as coordinating the two compound nouns.
